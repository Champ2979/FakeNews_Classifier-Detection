FakeNews_Classifier-Detection
To save todayâ€™s internet users from the plight of misinformation , our project approaches to develop a machine learning model (LSTM) that also includes the concept of web scrapping and thus would help user to determine whether the information they are going through is fake or real just by inputting either the text, image or URLs.

<h1>Approach</h1>
Developing a machine learning tool that would classify real and fake news as per the user input. The following methods and techniques would be used to accomplish the above task -
<ul>
  <li>Data Collection and Pre-Processing</li>
  <li>Feature Extraction</li>
  <li>Model Selection</li>
  <li>Model Training</li>
  <li>Model Validation</li>
  <li>Integration with Reverse Text or Image Search</li>
  <li>Model Deployment</li>
</ul>
